# Bangle.io

[Bangle.io](http://Bangle.io) is a modern web based note taking platform.

### You own your notes

- **Local:** Modify notes right from your computer. Think Notion, but local only.

- **No data lock-in:** bangle stores your notes in a human readable **_Markdown_** format.

### Not your usual note taking app

- **WYSIWYG**: Even though we save things in Markdown format, Bangle will enrich your eyes with rich text formatting.

- **Modern rich text editor:** Bangle uses its sister project [bangle.dev](https://github.com/bangle-io/bangle.dev) which unlocks us to build a powerful editor like [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) or [Dropbox paper](https://www.dropbox.com/paper) and support real time collaboration.

- **Extensibility:** Even though it's a web app it was built ground up to be extended by awesome extensions. (_We have bunch of community extensions coming out soon.)_

### Portability at its core

- **No Electron:**  :heart: for web and speed, thats it.

- **Performant:** Throw thousands of notes at it and Bangle will chug along fine. _(Try opening a heavy project like [10,000 Markdown Files](https://github.com/Zettelkasten-Method/10000-markdown-files).)_
