          Tabbed UI Premise: make it clear which file I am working on and improve the top level ogranization of the app. I think it is time to just create a master UI skeleton that I can try out independently and progressively enhance it for the user. Again prone to the itch of creation, I need to think about what skeleton will work best for me. MemUI, logSeq and many more in my notes, have decent UI , I just need to capture it.
