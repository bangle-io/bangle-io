A local note taking app for the rest of us 🐥

Hello,

Thanks for taking out the time to read about bangle.io. I know it is an insanely crowded market and every day a new note taking app pops up. Yet here I am, passionately working on this project for the past 3 years hoping people will like it.

(💡 yes you can edit this page!)

1. You own your notes

Bangle reads and stores notes from a folder of your choice right in your computer. This means your data stays local and never leaves your computer.

Bangle uses Markdown syntax to save your files so that to avoid data lock-in and keep it human readable.

2. Simple, extensible and powerful

Bangle is a WYSIWYG editor. It is surprising that majority of the fancy markdown note apps do not have WYSIWYG and force the user to switch context between two split screens. (Bangle has a split screen, but that is for multitasking different notes.)

I have spent a lot of time first perfecting the editor (see bangle.dev) which will me to build a powerful editor like Notion or Dropbox paper and support real time collaboration.

Extensibility is one of the reasons I wanted to build a new note taking app. The core features of bangle are encapsulated in an extension and I am working on finalizing the API to allow for community built extensions.

3. Portable

I ❤️ web and I strongly believe in PWAs, which is why I donot intend to make this an Electron app.

Bangle.io is fast and performant. Try opening a heavy project like 10,000 Markdown Files to test out the performance.

Why should you try it out?

The cost of trying it out is low, a there is no data lock-in because Bangle is completely local and uses Markdown syntax to read/write your notes.

Bangle.io is in its early stages, so expect some important features missing and some stability issues. If you are already happy with your current setup, thats great, but if you think there is potential her please help us spread the word, every bit counts 🙋‍♀️ !
